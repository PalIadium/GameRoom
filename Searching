Windows:
1. Command Line
  where /r [drive] *keyword1 keyword2*
  example usage: 
  where /r c: *Week1 Incident*


Linux:
1. locate vs find
locate is faster but relies on a database that is updated hours or days in the past so its output can be outdated
however because this database is old, locate can be used to find files that no longer exists

find runs in real time, can do things to files it finds, can point at a subdirectory, has powerful expression syntax,
