Zone Transfer: a process where one computer (primary server) shares all its information 
about a specific area of the internet (zone) to another computer (secondary server).

To perform zone transfer on a target primary server (exampleServerA) to an internal server (exampleServerIntern)


nslookup                  // starts nslookup tool, allows to interact with DNS servers
server exampleServerA     // switch to the nameserver exampleSeverA
set type=AXFR             // AXFR (authoritative transfer) for zone transfers
ls -d exampleServerIntern // requests zone transfer for the exampleServerIntern zone
